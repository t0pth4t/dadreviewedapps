# 1. Khan Academy Kids

Khan Academy Kids is by far and away the most educational free application for children. It is ***completely free*** with no dark patterns or advertising.

[Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.khankids.android&hl=en_US&gl=US)

[Download for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/khan-academy-kids/id1378467217)

# 2. Duolingo abc

Another great free app for children

[Download for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1440502568?mt=8)

# 3. PBS Kids Games

Completely free and Ad-free. Games have to be individually downloaded which can frustrate impatient kids (and parents). Hard to judge quality of individual quality and education of each app before downloading.

Works a lot better on iOS than Android
